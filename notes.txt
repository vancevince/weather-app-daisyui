- setting up single User. this is the point where I started trying to do the second api call to 
  get the forecast using the geographic context

- CityItem contains the link that will lead to the forecast page

- User.jsx under pages directory is the basis for FiveDayForecast.jsx
- tracked changs:
  - CityItem.jsx Link to attribute has /forecast landing
  - App.js has Route to FiveDayForecast
  - GeographicContext.js added city object to initial state, made it available to provider
  - getForecast function added to GeographicContext
